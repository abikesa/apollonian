    "> *\"It was important for us to have Thatcher's character, because there's a feeling of a country that was conquered through an economical model and through violence,” Larraín says. “And that is the cocktail that remains, I think, alive in our country.” - Pablo Lorraín, El Conde*\n",

    "<span style=\"font-size:23px;font-weight:bold;\">School of Resentment</span><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"School of Resentment\" was coined by literary critic Harold Bloom to describe various forms of literary critique that he considered to be driven by social or political considerations rather than aesthetic or intellectual ones. According to Bloom, these approaches, including feminist criticism, Marxist criticism, and other forms of socio-political critique, emphasize identity politics and societal structures at the expense of literary aesthetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some critics argue that this perspective neglects the importance of social context in understanding literature, Bloom insisted that the \"School of Resentment\" tends to reduce the complexity of literary works to mere expressions of power dynamics or social issues, rather than appreciating them as unique aesthetic creations.\n",

    "<span style=\"font-size:23px;font-weight:bold;\">Harold Bloom on Borges</span><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Harold Bloom had high praise for Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, considering him a significant figure in the Western literary canon. Borges' work often explores intricate labyrinths of thought, and he is known for his erudite storytelling that blurs the lines between fiction and non-fiction, reality and unreality. Though Borges predates the boom of magical realism that would later dominate Latin American literature, some of his stories include elements that could be considered precursors to magical realism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bloom admired Borges for his intellectual rigor and the aesthetic merits of his work, placing him outside what he termed the \"School of Resentment.\" Borges' writing is rich in philosophical inquiry and explores themes like the nature of time, identity, and reality, often without explicitly engaging with social or political issues.\n",

    "<span style=\"font-size:23px;font-weight:bold;\">Magical Realism in South America</span><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The flourishing of magical realism in South America can be understood through several lenses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Colonial Legacy**: South America's colonial past and its subsequent history of political turmoil created a fertile ground for the exploration of themes related to oppression, identity, and resistance—themes that magical realism can articulate effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cultural Hybridity**: The blending of indigenous beliefs with European influences created a rich cultural landscape, ideal for the magical realist synthesis of different worldviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Political Climate**: Given the often unstable political conditions, magical realism could serve both as an escape from and a critique of reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Oral Tradition**: The strong tradition of storytelling in many South American cultures lends itself well to magical realism, where folklore and contemporary issues often intertwine.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Spiritual Worldview**: In many South American cultures, the spiritual and the earthly co-exist as part of everyday life, a worldview easily channeled into the magical realist genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "Magical realism could be seen as a form of counter-narrative to dominant Western perspectives, offering alternative ways to represent reality and to speak about complex social and historical issues. So, in a way, magical realism could be seen as resonating with the goals of what Bloom calls the \"School of Resentment,\" even if the genre itself is not reducible to mere social critique.\n",
