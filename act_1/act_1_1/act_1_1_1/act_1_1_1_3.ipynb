    "\n",
    "> *\"There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries.\" - Julius Caesar, Act 4, Scene 3*\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:23px;font-weight:bold;\">The Power of the Tide</span><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This poignant metaphor captures the essence of the UN's mission for a more equitable world. In the open sea, all boats rise with the tide, transcending artificial hierarchies. Yet, for this to occur, the boats—representing underserved communities—must be afloat.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:23px;font-weight:bold;\">Capitalism, Technology, and Inequality</span><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Capitalism has ushered in rapid economic growth but often at the cost of widening social inequalities. Today, we stand at a similar crossroads with the emergence of transformative technologies like large language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:23px;font-weight:bold;\">The Cellphone Paradigm</span><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The proliferation of cellphones in rural and low-income regions serves as a powerful example. These devices have slashed business costs and connected isolated communities to the global network. Now, AI technologies like ChatGPT have the potential to make similar strides in the field of education.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:23px;font-weight:bold;\">The Urgency of Adoption</span><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hesitation and over-regulation can lead to missed opportunities. Just as ships must take the tide at its flood to reach fortune, delaying AI adoption will only magnify global disparities. The time to act is now, especially when considering the untenable student-to-teacher ratios in many developing regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:23px;font-weight:bold;\">Teacher-Centric AI</span><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our focus should be on enhancing the productivity of teachers in curriculum design, student engagement, and evaluation. AI can be a potent tool in the hands of educators, allowing for a more tailored, dynamic, and effective teaching approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:23px;font-weight:bold;\">Cost-Efficiency</span><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a scenario where multiple teachers can share a single OpenAI account, thereby democratizing access to top-notch educational resources. This cost-efficiency is crucial in settings where budgets are tight yet the needs are vast.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:23px;font-weight:bold;\">Conclusion</span><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first time, we can truly say that all children globally could have access to the same high-quality educational resources through AI. Let us not squander this tide of opportunity on the instinct of caution. It's time to take the current when it serves and lead our ventures to fortune.\n",
